* Messy ideas
** Idea 1: General code analyzer
A command line tool that asks for the path to files to review, reads them, then asks a series of questions to clarify design decisions and understand the style of the programmer and not disrespect those intentions while still be helpful.

This should be configurable with an API key. You should also be able to seed your experience level as a programmer on first use and this should be stored in the configuration.
