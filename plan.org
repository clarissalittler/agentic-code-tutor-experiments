* Messy ideas
** DONE Idea 1: General code analyzer
CLOSED: [2025-11-05]

A command line tool that asks for the path to files to review, reads them, then asks a series of questions to clarify design decisions and understand the style of the programmer and not disrespect those intentions while still be helpful.

This should be configurable with an API key. You should also be able to seed your experience level as a programmer on first use and this should be stored in the configuration.

*** Implementation Status
- [X] Core CLI tool with Click framework
- [X] Configuration management (~/.config/code-tutor/config.json)
- [X] API key storage and management
- [X] Experience level configuration (beginner/intermediate/advanced/expert)
- [X] Question style preferences (socratic/direct/exploratory)
- [X] Focus areas selection (design, readability, performance, etc.)
- [X] File reading and language detection (30+ languages supported)
- [X] Interactive questioning system using Claude API
- [X] Personalized feedback based on user's answers
- [X] Follow-up conversation capability
- [X] Multi-file and directory review support
- [X] Rich formatted output using Rich library
- [X] Comprehensive documentation (DESIGN.md, README.md)
